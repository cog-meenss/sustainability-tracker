Timestamp: 2025-11-09 19:15:00
Workflow: Comprehensive Sustainability Analysis
Expected: Should trigger automatically on push to main branch

## Expected Workflow Behavior

1. ✅ **Trigger**: Push to main branch should start the workflow
2. ✅ **Analysis**: Run comprehensive_sustainability_evaluator.py  
3. ✅ **Reports**: Generate HTML and JSON comprehensive reports
4. ✅ **Job Summary**: Display interactive dashboard with metrics
5. ✅ **Artifacts**: Upload reports for 30-day retention
6. ✅ **Quality Gate**: Evaluate against 75/100 threshold

## Current Project Status
- Overall Score: 30.2/100 (Expected: ❌ FAIL - below 75 threshold)
- Energy Efficiency: 0/100 (Critical)
- Performance Issues: 815+ detected
- Expected Result: Build should fail due to low sustainability score
